# Balagan (בלגן)

Balagan is an R-package dedicated to the study of large-scale highly-multiplexed imaging datasets. It contains several tools allowing to :
- Normalize and process the original data, i.e transforming and clustering the data.
- Vizualise the data with various plotting functions.
- Study and quantify cell-cell interactions using various interaction scores derived from the spatial point pattern theory and tensor decomposition approaches.
- Infer the best parameters for an optimal spatial sampling strategy.
- Predict sparse multi-range interaction models (Implementation of PenGE package)
